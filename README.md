# sinatra-nnktoo

Sinatra Project Idea Broadly inspired by the Video Game Ni no Kuni 2.

In this project, users (or rulers) are able to create kingdoms with citizens. Rulers can have multiple kingdoms but kingdoms can only have one ruler. Kingdoms can have citizens and citizens can exist in multiple kingdoms. Citizens each have a role in the kingdom(s) they are part of. Users can also wear various outfits.

# Usage

To use this app, just clone, run rake db:migrate and then run shotgun. Everything should be set up.
